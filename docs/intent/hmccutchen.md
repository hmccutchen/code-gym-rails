## Mon Oct 19, 2026

- swap sheet spec rewritten around the new mockup `#424`
- a swap recorded against the held set it was made on `#425`
- the inline swap picker replaced with a bottom sheet `#426`
- design specs taken out of the repo `#427`
- installed the `layered-rails` and `good-readme` plugins
- profiled boot: about 0.66s warm, unused Active Storage, Action Mailbox and
  Action Text cost about 50ms
- the intent-log skill in the repo, and an entry required on every PR `#428`
  **why:** I wanted it always used for our PRs, and it only lived on my machine
  **I decided:** commit the skill to the repo rather than point CLAUDE.md at a
  personal skill
- the README as a product page for individual engineers, with the app icon
  `#429`
  **why:** I wanted it to say what the product is and who it's for
  **I decided:** it's a private product at coding-gym.pro, not an open-source
  project, so the setup and contributing sections went
- layered-architecture review of `app/`, larger findings filed as issues
- checked the three older open issues
  **I decided:** keep all three; the gate one stays deferred with a note on
  what saved state now has to carry
- an unfinished Gemini call raises and still records its usage `#437`
- the app's visible name from Code Gym to Coding Gym, to match coding-gym.pro
  `#438`
  **why:** the name people see should match the domain I'm about to show
  developers
  **I decided:** the session cookie, storage keys and code names keep the old
  name, since renaming the cookie signs everyone out; the README and
  CONTEXT.md get renamed because the repo is public; the generation prompts go
  in their own PR straight after, because rewriting the prompt snapshots is a
  generation change, and nothing that freezes a day for public viewing lands
  before it
- provider error classes moved off `AiService` into a `ProviderError` family
  `#441`
  **why:** the layered review found models depending on the provider client
  **I decided:** `ProviderError` as the home, no aliases, field lists in a
  second PR, `LANGUAGE_PROMPTS` left alone
- setup problems recorded as their own kind, not as provider failures `#444`
  **I decided:** changed my mind: record them as setup, since failing
  unrescued left pages spinning
- the rest of `AiService`'s domain data moved onto the models `#445`
- generation logging moved into `GenerationDiagnostics` `#448`
  **I decided:** diagnostics before prompts
- pseudocode prompts into `PseudocodePrompt` `#450`
- shared prompt text into `PromptStandards` `#452`

## Tue Oct 20

- the follow-up and alternate caps moved into `DailyResponse`, from the
  layered review's issue `#449`
  **I decided:** ran the critical review against what had merged since, and
  took its fixes in this PR: the review page reads the caps from the model too,
  and a spec now fails if the lock goes
- concept reference and its reframe into `ConceptReferencePrompt` `#453`
- recognition guide into `RecognitionGuidePrompt` `#454`
- section explain-differently into `ExplainDifferentlyPrompt` `#455`
- follow-ups into `FollowUpPrompt` `#457`
- an issue for the browser specs that fail on slow runs
- duck into `DuckPrompt` `#458`
- difficulty assessment into `DifficultyPrompt` `#459`
- section judge into `SectionJudgePrompt` `#460`
- review prose judge into `ReviewProseJudgePrompt` `#461`
- the two-stage review into `ReviewPrompt` `#463`
- load each area rule with its prompt classes `#464`
  **why:** Railway builds were having problems, so I asked for it stacked on
  the review PR, to merge in order once they recover
- the generation system prompt into `GenerationPrompt.system_prompt` `#466`
- landed the generation system prompt move on main, since it merged into
  its stacked base `#467`
- language wording and scenario pools into `LanguagePrompts` and
  `ScenarioPools` `#468`
- landed the domain modules move on main, since it merged into its
  stacked base too `#469`
- ladder loading into `GenerationLadders`, the first of two PRs for
  issue 431's orchestration step `#470`
  **why:** I kept drafting out of `JudgedGeneration`, since unjudged days
  draft too; each step is its own PR from main, as the issue says
- drafting into `ExerciseDraft`, the second PR for issue 431's
  orchestration step `#471`
  **why:** I had the draft carry its user and language so the retry takes
  only the draft, kind and concept

## Wed Oct 21
- the pseudocode critique claim onto `DailyResponse`, with a token so a
  stale caller can't clear a newer claim `#474`
- one raising `wait_for` and one 20-second wait limit for the system specs
  `#475`
  **why:** I chose that a Submit clicked while a controller is still loading
  should wait for it; the app already does, and the spec was fixed instead
